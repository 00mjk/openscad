Snapshot builds, also called developmental builds, can be 
semi-automatically built and uploaded, and the openscad.org website 
updated with the new links, by a single script, 'scripts/snapshot.sh'.

Prerequisites:

- Your .ssh keys have to be set up on the openscad.org website and on 
the file host for openscad

- You need a linux machine with several gigabytes of free space in $HOME

Usage:

Create a clean directory, and cd into it.

  rm -rf ./build
  mkdir build
  cd build

Now run the snapshot script from within the clean directory:
  
  ../../somewhere/openscad/scripts/snapshot.sh

This will set off the snapshot builder process, which is basically as follows:

  check for MXE cross-build environment and dependencies. if needed, 
  download and build them in $HOME/openscad_deps (this takes several hours)

  cross-build the Windows(TM) snapshots, for 32 bit and 64 bit

  upload the binaries to the openscad file host

  download the openscad.github.com website

  change the html/javascript on the website to reflect the new binaries

  commit and push the changes.

For detailed usage, please see the beginning of the snapshot.sh file.
